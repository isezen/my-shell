### Changed
- Reorganized development scripts:
  - Moved `check-aliases.sh` and `ll-performance.sh` from project root to `scripts/dev/` directory
  - Updated `check-aliases.sh` to use `PROJECT_ROOT` variable for proper path resolution from new location
  - Updated Makefile `check-aliases` target to reference `scripts/dev/check-aliases.sh`
  - Updated `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to reference `scripts/dev/check-aliases.sh` for alias synchronization check
- Enhanced pre-commit hook integration:
  - Updated `.git/hooks/pre-commit` to call pre-commit framework, ensuring all hooks from `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (including `check-aliases-sync`) are executed
  - `check-aliases.sh` is now managed exclusively through `.pre-commit-config.yaml` instead of direct hook integration
- Updated documentation and enhanced project structure:
  - Added comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
  - Moved `IMPROVEMENTS.md` to the `docs/` directory for better organization
- Refactored script for improved readability and performance:
  - Corrected spelling errors in comments for clarity
  - Introduced size and time constants to enhance code maintainability
  - Refactored functions to use local variables and improved formatting for better readability
  - Optimized size and time calculations for performance improvements
  - Updated comments for better understanding of the code flow
- Refactored environment activation scripts for improved usability and functionality:
  - Enhanced the `activate`, `reactivate`, and `deactivate` functions across Bash, Zsh, and Fish scripts
  - Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` to clarify the new activation options and usage instructions
  - Improved error handling and user feedback during activation and deactivation processes
  - Removed global function saving in `my_settings.fish` to simplify function management
  - Added support for shell switching and temporary directory management during activation
- Enhanced shell detection and activation process in environment scripts:
  - Improved the detection of the current shell by utilizing the parent process command for better accuracy
  - Refactored activation logic to handle shell switching more effectively, ensuring that the user's interactive shell is properly activated
  - Added cleanup procedures in the `deactivate` function to manage temporary artifacts and session states
  - Enhanced user feedback during shell switching to improve the overall activation experience
- Updated activation messages in environment script for improved clarity
- Refactored shell detection logic in activation script for improved accuracy
- Enhanced environment activation scripts for improved user experience:
  - Updated prompt formatting in `bash.sh` to include a clear (my-shell) prefix
  - Refactored the `activate` scripts across Bash, Zsh, and Fish to ensure consistent spawning of new interactive shells during activation
  - Simplified the deactivation process by removing unnecessary shell switching logic and ensuring proper cleanup of temporary artifacts
  - Improved user feedback during activation and deactivation to enhance clarity and usability
- Refactored Zsh prompt configuration and activation script for improved clarity:
  - Simplified the activation logic in `activate.zsh` to source `zsh.zsh` directly and ensure consistent prompt prefixing
- Updated activation scripts to prevent loading user startup files:
  - Modified the Bash and Fish activation commands to use `--noprofile` and `--no-config` options, respectively, ensuring that user-specific startup files are not loaded during shell activation
  - Enhanced the isolation of the Zsh environment by keeping `ZDOTDIR` isolated, allowing for a clean startup without user configurations
- Refactored prompt prefix management for better separation of concerns:
  - Removed `(my-shell)` prefix from `bash.sh` and `zsh.zsh` files - these files now only handle prompt formatting
  - Moved `(my-shell)` prefix management to activation scripts (`activate.bash`, `activate.zsh`, `activate.fish`) for centralized control
  - Changed prefix color from cyan to magenta for better visual distinction
  - Activation scripts now add the prefix after sourcing prompt configuration files, ensuring consistent behavior across all shells
- Major refactor: Restructured project directory layout for better organization and maintainability:
  - **New directory structure**: 
    - `scripts/bin/` - All executable scripts moved from `scripts/` to `scripts/bin/` for clearer separation
    - `shell/{bash,zsh,fish}/` - Shell-specific configurations organized by shell type
      - Each shell has `init.*` (entrypoint), `aliases.*`, `prompt.*`, and `env.*` files
  - **Config file organization**: Split monolithic config files into modular components:
    - Bash: `alias.sh` and `bash.sh` → `shell/bash/{init,aliases,prompt,env}.bash`
    - Zsh: `alias.zsh` and `zsh.zsh` → `shell/zsh/{init,aliases,prompt,env}.zsh`
    - Fish: `my_settings.fish` → `shell/fish/{init,aliases,prompt,env}.fish`
  - **Activation system**: Updated to use single entrypoint (`init.*`) files:
    - Activation scripts now source `shell/*/init.*` instead of multiple files
    - PATH updated to use `scripts/bin/` instead of `scripts/`
    - Simplified activation logic with better separation of concerns
  - **Installer modernization**: Unified installation into single `install.sh` script:
    - Combined settings and scripts installation into one installer
    - Removed `lib/provider.sh` dependency (logic moved inline)
    - Added interactive overwrite prompts with `-y/--yes` bypass option
    - Enhanced CLI with `--settings-only`, `--scripts-only` options
    - Automatic shell and OS detection with smart defaults
    - Environment variable support for customization
- Enhanced unified installer (`install.sh`) with flexible installation paths:
  - Added `--user` flag to install scripts to `$HOME/.local/bin` (user mode)
  - Added `--bin-prefix PATH` option for custom installation directory (overrides `--user` and `MY_SHELL_BIN_PREFIX`)
  - Implemented BIN_PREFIX precedence: `--bin-prefix` > `MY_SHELL_BIN_PREFIX` > `--user` > default (`/usr/local/bin`)
  - Simplified OS detection: removed Homebrew/MacPorts checks, always defaults to `/usr/local/bin` on Darwin/Linux
  - Improved permission handling: BIN_PREFIX check only runs when installing scripts (allows settings-only installs without sudo)
  - Enhanced error messages: actionable suggestions when `/usr/local/bin` is not writable (suggests sudo, `--user`, or `--bin-prefix`)
  - Fixed file permissions: settings files use `0644`, scripts use `+x` (executable)
  - Early OS validation: installer dies immediately on unsupported OS (Darwin/Linux only)
  - Added `--dry-run=PATH` option for sandbox mode testing:
    - All file operations (installations, RC file modifications) are redirected to sandbox directory
    - No modifications to real system files (HOME, RC files, /usr/local/bin, etc.)
    - Effective path mapping: HOME → `$DRY_RUN_ROOT/HOME`, absolute paths → `$DRY_RUN_ROOT$PATH`
    - Supports both local and remote source modes in dry-run
    - Useful for testing installer behavior without affecting real system
    - Debug logging shows effective paths for easier test assertions
  - **Test updates**: Updated all test files to reference new directory structure

### Fixed
- Fixed critical ShellCheck error in `alias.sh:50`: Added missing quotes around variable in `[ -n "$gnuls" ]` check
- Fixed critical ShellCheck error in `alias.sh:187`: Converted `hs` alias to function (aliases can't use positional parameters)

- Fixed ShellCheck warnings: SC2164 (cd error handling), SC2016 (variable expansion), SC2155 (local assignment), SC2086 (quoting), SC2046 (word splitting), SC2003 (expr usage), SC2034 (unused variables), SC2323 (unnecessary parentheses), SC2033 (alias in external commands)
- Fixed ShellCheck warnings in `colortable.sh`: SC2046 (command substitution quoting), SC2059 (printf format string)
- Fixed ShellCheck warnings in `install_shell_settings.sh`: SC2016 (added ignore comment for fish syntax)

- Fixed all ShellCheck style warnings: SC2004 (arithmetic variables in alias.sh and ll-performance.sh), SC2012 (ls to find), SC2059 (printf format), SC2262 (alias definition/usage), SC2139/SC2263/SC2032/SC2317 (added to .shellcheckrc as intentional behavior)
- Created `.shellcheckrc` to disable intentional warnings (SC2139, SC2262, SC2263, SC2032, SC2317)
